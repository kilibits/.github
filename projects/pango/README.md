# 🔥 Introducing **Mkoba** — Because your community finance shouldn't be tied to your network provider

> *"Finally, an app that I've been waiting for."* — Probably everyone once they try it

## What is Ember?

We have reimagined the concept of "kikoba" as a standalone application, where you can pay in with mobile money, debit cards, request and manage loans.

We strongly believe this should never be tied to your network provider, the money flow should be open and visible to all members
